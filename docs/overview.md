# Managing Modernization at Scale: A Vision for Firm-Wide Technical Debt Management

## Executive Summary

Over the past two years, we have proven that technical debt can be measured and managed at scale. Our Technology Modernization fleet has helped developers modernize over 1,500 applications, delivering measurable business outcomes: delivery lead times reduced by 20%, and change failure rates cut in half across the board.

We started this journey with 11 key measurements. Now, we're ready to expand our impact.

This document outlines our vision and plan to measure and manage technical debt in all its forms across the firm. By meeting developers where they are in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)—from planning through operations—we will make modernization journeys frictionless, actionable, and aligned with business value.

**Our approach is built on three pillars:**

- **Modern Architecture** - Well-designed systems that scale and adapt
- **Modern Technology** - Current platforms, languages, and tools
- **Modern Practices** - Efficient workflows and engineering excellence

This is not just about technology. It's about enabling agility, reducing risk, and lowering costs across the entire firm. And it's about building the capabilities—backed by TechMod—to sustain modernization at scale for years to come.

## The Cost of Technical Debt

Technical debt is not just a technical problem—it's a business problem. It directly impacts our ability to deliver on three core technology values:

**1. Enable Growth & Efficiency**

Technical debt slows us down. Legacy systems, outdated technologies, and poorly documented architectures increase development lead times and delay time to deployment readiness. Every day spent navigating technical debt is a day not spent delivering customer value.

**2. Strengthen Resilience**

Technical debt increases risk. High change failure rates, security vulnerabilities in aging dependencies, and brittle systems that break under change all stem from accumulated technical debt. Resilient systems require modern foundations.

**3. Improve Effectiveness**

Technical debt drains engineering capacity. When developers spend time working around limitations rather than building new capabilities, we reduce pull requests per developer and increase the cost of maintaining our technology infrastructure.

### The Opportunity

The good news? We can measure these impacts—and we can improve them.

One example: A super department supporting our Investment Banking & Global Capital Markets business reduced their overall lead times by **25%**—from over 1 month per feature to just over 3 weeks—while keeping headcount flat. They achieved this by reducing the number of applications they manage and cutting dependencies on legacy and high-risk technologies.

**This is the opportunity modernization unlocks:** improved agility, reduced risk, and lower investment costs—all achievable with modest effort when approached systematically.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to **measure and help the firm manage technical debt in all its forms**.

We do this through **TechMod**—our Strategic Product Management platform that provides centralized tracking, measurement, and governance of modernization efforts across the firm.

### From 11 Measurements to Comprehensive Coverage

We started with 11 key measurements that gave us visibility into critical aspects of technical debt. These measurements proved their value: they guided over 1,500 application modernizations and delivered measurable improvements in lead times, stability, and delivery performance.

Now, we're expanding our scope to cover technical debt across **three pillars of modernization**:

**Modern Architecture**

- Well-designed systems that scale and adapt
- Clear separation of concerns and bounded contexts
- Architectural patterns that enable agility and maintainability

**Modern Technology**

- Current platforms, languages, and frameworks
- Elimination of deprecated and high-risk dependencies
- Technology choices aligned with firm standards and industry best practices

**Modern Practices**

- Efficient workflows and engineering excellence
- Automated testing, deployment, and operations
- Documentation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing

By measuring technical debt across all three pillars, we can provide a complete picture of modernization health and guide teams toward sustainable improvement.

## Guiding Principles

Our approach to measuring and managing technical debt is grounded in principles that ensure our work delivers real value to developers and the firm:

### 0. Value-Driven Measurement

Every measurement must tie back to our technology value drivers: Enable Growth & Efficiency, Strengthen Resilience, and Improve Effectiveness. We don't measure for measurement's sake—we measure what matters to business outcomes.

### 1. Accuracy and Reliability

Our measurements must be objective, consistent, and trustworthy. Developers need to trust the data to take action on it. We prioritize automated, tool-based measurements over subjective assessments wherever possible.

### 2. Actionable Scores

Scores and metrics are only valuable if developers can act on them. Every measurement must come with clear guidance: what does this score mean? What should I do about it? How do I improve it?

### 3. Efficient Recipes

Our modernization "recipes"—the patterns, tools, and workflows we provide—must be as efficient as possible. We reduce friction, automate where we can, and provide clear, repeatable paths to improvement. Developer time is precious; we respect it by making modernization journeys as smooth as possible.

### 4. Meet Developers Where They Are

We integrate modernization guidance directly into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)—from planning through operations. Whether a developer is drafting a requirement in Jira, authoring an ADR, writing code in their IDE, or reviewing a deployment pipeline, our tooling meets them in their workflow with relevant, timely guidance.

### 5. Common Solutions for Common Problems

We promote re-use and convergence on proven patterns. When applications solve the same problem in different ways, we measure that divergence and guide teams toward shared solutions. This reduces duplication, lowers maintenance burden, and leverages tried-and-tested approaches rather than continuously rediscovering what doesn't work.

## Prioritization Framework

With potentially 50-100 different forms of technical debt we could measure and manage, we need a clear framework for deciding where to focus our efforts. Not all technical debt is created equal, and not all of it is worth tackling immediately.

We prioritize technical debt based on three critical criteria:

### 1. Value Alignment

**Can we tie this technical debt to one or more of our technology value drivers?**

Technical debt that clearly impacts Growth & Efficiency, Resilience, or Effectiveness takes priority. Interesting metrics that don't connect to business outcomes are lower priority—we don't measure for measurement's sake.

### 2. Measurement Accuracy

**Can we measure this technical debt accurately and reliably?**

We need objective, consistent measurements that developers trust. Technical debt that requires subjective assessment or manual data collection is harder to scale and less reliable. We prioritize areas where we can automate measurement and provide consistent, trustworthy data.

### 3. Manageability

**Can developers effectively manage and reduce this technical debt?**

Even if we can measure something accurately, if the journey to fix it is arduous, difficult, or unpalatable for developers, adoption will be low and impact will be limited. We prioritize technical debt where we can provide efficient recipes, clear guidance, and practical paths to improvement.

### Our Priority Quadrants

Based on these criteria, technical debt falls into four quadrants:

**Quadrant 1: Low Priority**

- Cannot tie to value drivers
- Interesting but unclear business impact
- Deprioritize until value connection is established

**Quadrant 2: Future Opportunity**

- Clear value driver
- Difficult to measure accurately and reliably
- Invest in measurement capabilities before rolling out

**Quadrant 3: Needs Enablement**

- Clear value driver
- Can measure accurately
- No effective management path (arduous, difficult journey)
- Build recipes and tooling before broad rollout

**Quadrant 4: Active Focus** ⭐

- Clear value driver
- Can measure accurately and reliably
- Can be managed effectively with reasonable effort
- **This is where we focus first**

Our current measurements (listed in each pillar above) are all in Quadrant 4. Our future measurements represent our pipeline—investments we're making to move items from Quadrants 2 and 3 into Quadrant 4.

### Governance

## Our Definition of Modernization

Modernization is not a single activity—it's a holistic transformation across three interconnected pillars. Each pillar addresses a different dimension of technical debt and requires distinct measurement and intervention strategies.

### Modern Architecture

Modern Architecture means building systems that are maintainable, scalable, and adaptable to change. It's about reducing complexity and increasing clarity.

**Concrete examples include:**

- **Microservices and Domain-Driven Design**: Breaking monoliths into well-bounded services that can evolve independently
- **API-First Design**: Clear contracts between systems that enable loose coupling and parallel development
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication patterns that improve resilience and scalability
- **Cloud-Native Patterns**: Leveraging cloud capabilities like auto-scaling, managed services, and infrastructure as code
- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Documenting why architectural choices were made to maintain context over time
- **Dependency Management**: Understanding and minimizing coupling between components and systems
- **Data Architecture**: Modern data platforms, clear data ownership, and appropriate persistence strategies

**Our approach to measuring Modern Architecture:**

Modern Architecture is the most challenging pillar to measure objectively. Guided by our principles—particularly the need for accurate, reliable, and actionable measurements—we are starting focused and pragmatic.

We leverage **Moderne's Moddy** to measure code objectively and automatically. Our initial focus is on **divergence**: when applications across the firm solve the same problem in different ways. This creates opportunities for **convergence** toward common solutions.

This approach directly supports our technology principle of **"Common Solutions for Common Problems"** with clear outcomes:

- **Reduce duplication**: Less code to write and maintain
- **Lower volume**: Smaller, more focused codebases
- **Proven patterns**: Roll out tried-and-tested solutions rather than rediscovering what doesn't work

By measuring divergence, we can guide teams toward re-use, reduce architectural complexity over time, and ensure consistent patterns across the firm.

**What we currently measure:**

- Code divergence patterns using Moderne's Moddy (identifying when applications solve the same problems differently)
- Opportunities for convergence toward common solutions

**What we will measure:**

- Architectural complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, coupling, cohesion)
- System dependency maps and criticality analysis
- ADR coverage, quality, and adherence
- Service boundaries and API design quality
- Database modernization (monolithic databases, data lakes, event streams)
- Re-use metrics (shared libraries, common components, pattern adoption)

### Modern Technology

Modern Technology means staying current with platforms, languages, frameworks, and tools that are actively supported, secure, and performant.

**Concrete examples include:**

- **Language and Runtime Versions**: Moving from Java 8 to Java 21, Python 2 to Python 3, Node 14 to Node 20
- **Framework Currency**: Upgrading Spring Boot, React, Angular versions to maintain security and feature support
- **Deprecated Dependencies**: Eliminating libraries that are no longer maintained or have known vulnerabilities
- **Cloud Platform Services**: Migrating from self-managed infrastructure to managed services (RDS, Lambda, container orchestration)
- **Containerization**: Moving from VMs to Docker/Kubernetes for consistency and portability
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Adopting Terraform, CloudFormation, or similar tools for reproducible infrastructure
- **Observability Stack**: Modern monitoring, logging, and tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)
- **Security Tooling**: Static analysis, dependency scanning, secrets management

**How we define and communicate modernity:**

We leverage the **TBM 5 taxonomy** to organize all technology products into sensible categories and sub-categories. Within each product sub-category, we define what is considered "modern" and what is "legacy," providing clear guidance to help developers on their modernization journey.

These decisions are documented in **Product Decision Records (PDRs)**—inspired by Architectural Decision Records—that capture:

- **Why**: The rationale behind the modernity classification
- **Business Case**: The value and impact of modernization
- **Options Evaluated**: Alternative technologies and approaches considered
- **Pros/Cons**: Trade-offs for each option
- **Implications**: What this means for teams using or migrating from these technologies

_[Diagram of TBM 5 taxonomy and product sub-categories to be added]_

**What we currently measure:**

- Technology version currency for critical languages and frameworks
- End-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) tracking for major platforms
- High-severity CVE exposure

**What we will measure:**

- Comprehensive technology version currency across all language runtimes, frameworks, and libraries
- Full CVE exposure and security vulnerability tracking
- License compliance and open-source governance
- Infrastructure modernization metrics (VM to container, on-prem to cloud)
- Tooling adoption rates (IaC, observability, security scanning)
- PDR coverage and adoption rates per TBM category
- Technology portfolio distribution (modern vs legacy by product sub-category)

### Modern Practices

Modern Practices means adopting workflows, processes, and engineering disciplines that enable teams to deliver faster, more reliably, and with higher quality.

**Concrete examples include:**

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines that reduce manual toil and increase delivery frequency
- **Testing Automation & Practice**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests as first-class artifacts with appropriate coverage
- **Monorepos**: Unified code repositories that improve code sharing, refactoring, and atomic changes across services
- **Feature Flags**: Decoupling deployment from release for safer rollouts and progressive delivery
- **Agentic Development Practice**: AI-assisted coding, automated code reviews, and intelligent development tools that augment developer capabilities
- **Fast Inner Development Loops**: Rapid feedback cycles with fast local builds, hot-reloading, and quick test execution
- **Code Review Practices**: Consistent, timely reviews that improve code quality and knowledge sharing
- **Documentation Culture**: Living documentation, runbooks, API specs, onboarding guides
- **Incident Management**: Blameless postmortems, on-call rotations, SLO/SLA tracking
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Version-controlled, reviewable infrastructure changes

**What we currently measure:**

- Deployment frequency and lead time for changes
- Change failure rate and mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Pull request metrics (size, review time, throughput)

**What we will measure:**

- Test coverage and test execution time
- Documentation coverage and freshness
- Pipeline automation percentage
- Build and test execution times (inner loop speed)
- Developer productivity indicators
- Incident response metrics
