# Ubiquitous Language (Developer-Facing)

This document defines the canonical vocabulary used across the TechMod modernization platform from the perspective of a developer who owns and maintains an application. It spans strategic, tactical, and operational layers and aligns with the platform's bounded contexts.

---

## 1. Strategic Vocabulary

### Application

A software system owned by a developer or team. The primary unit of modernization.

### Modernization

The continuous improvement of an application's technology, architecture, and engineering practices to reduce risk, improve speed, and increase value.

### Value Driver

The strategic reasons for modernization:

- **Growth & Efficiency**
- **Resilience**
- **Effectiveness**

### Outcome Metric

A measurable indicator of application performance (e.g., Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, MTTR, Incident Volume).

### Modernity

The degree to which an application's technologies, architecture, and practices align with firm standards.

### Modernization Score

A composite score representing modernization health.

### Modernization Posture

Categorizes overall health: **Healthy**, **Lagging**, **At Risk**, or **Critical**.

### Opportunity

A specific improvement that advances modernization (e.g., "Upgrade to Node.js 20").

### Journey

A guided modernization path from current state to a defined target state.

---

## 2. Tactical Vocabulary

### Application Inventory

A detected list of technologies, frameworks, dependencies, and configurations for an application.

### Current State

The developer’s starting point—versions, patterns, practices, architecture, and metrics.

### Target State

The desired modern outcome defined by a journey (e.g., upgraded runtime or migrated datastore).

### Benefit

The expected positive impact of performing a modernization opportunity.

### Effort

Estimated complexity of completing the opportunity: **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

### Opportunity Card

A UI element summarizing a modernization opportunity, including benefit, effort, and value driver.

### Modernization Delta

The expected improvement in outcome metrics.

### Detected Risk

An automatically identified issue such as deprecated or unsupported technologies.

### Recommendation

A prioritized modernization opportunity relevant to the application.

### Recipe

An automated transformation used within a journey, often using Moderne.

### Assessment

An automated analysis of technology currency, architecture divergences, or practices.

---

## 3. Operational Vocabulary

### Journey Execution

The act of performing a modernization journey, often involving automation and developer validation.

### State Checkpoint

A recorded point in a journey capturing progress and decisions.

### Automated Change

A code or configuration modification produced by a recipe.

### Pull Request (PR) Proposal

A PR generated by the system as a result of a recipe or journey step.

### Diagnostic Run

A system-triggered evaluation to verify readiness for modernization.

### Validation Step

A point where developer approval is required before continuing.

### Rollback Point

A stored state the system can revert to if needed.

### Success Criteria

The measurable conditions for successful completion of a journey.

### Completion

The point where a journey reaches its target state and the application’s modernization score updates.

### Telemetry Event

A recorded event capturing modernization actions.
