# Taxonomy Schema Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines proposed enhancements to model the 3 hierarchical levels of the Taxonomy schema.

## Hierarchical Structure

The taxonomy consists of three hierarchical levels that map to TBM (Technology Business Management) terms:

| Hierarchy Level  | Our Term          | TBM Term |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Level 1 (Top)    | Product Portfolio | Type     |
| Level 2 (Middle) | Product Line      | Category |
| Level 3 (Bottom) | Product Category  | Name     |

## Proposed Schema Enhancements

### Level 1: Product Portfolio (TBM Type)

- **Purpose**: Highest level grouping of related products
- **Characteristics**: Strategic business units or major product families
- **Relationship**: Contains multiple Product Lines

### Level 2: Product Line (TBM Category)

- **Purpose**: Mid-level grouping within a Product Portfolio
- **Characteristics**: Related products serving similar market segments
- **Relationship**: Belongs to one Product Portfolio, contains multiple Product Categories

### Level 3: Product Category (TBM Name)

- **Purpose**: Specific product groupings at the most granular level
- **Characteristics**: Individual products or closely related product variants
- **Relationship**: Belongs to one Product Line

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Hierarchical Integrity**: Ensure proper parent-child relationships are maintained
2. **Data Consistency**: Validate that all levels follow the established hierarchy
3. **Scalability**: Design to accommodate future expansion of the taxonomy
4. **TBM Compliance**: Maintain alignment with TBM framework standards
